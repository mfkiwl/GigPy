# GigPy
Gps-based Imaging Geodesy software in PYthon (GigPy) is an open source package for analyzing spaito-temporal GPS products (tropospheric delays, water vapor delay or atmospheric water vapor, ground displacement) from an imaging perspective. It searches and downloads gps products over an area of interest from [Nevada Geodetic Laboratory](http://geodesy.unr.edu/) and [UNAVCO](https://www.unavco.org/).
