Gps-based Imaging Geodesy software in PYthon (GigPy) is an open source package for analyzing spaito-temporal GPS products (tropospheric delays, water vapor delay or atmospheric water vapor, ground displacement) from an imaging-geodesy perspective. It searches and downloads gps products over an area of interest from [Nevada Geodetic Laboratory](http://geodesy.unr.edu/) and [UNAVCO](https://www.unavco.org/), use state-of-the art algorithms to analyze different components (topography-correlated, spatial trend component, turbulent component) of the GPS products, and robustly reconstruct the high-resolution maps of different GPS products, which could be useful in areas of meteorology (atmospheric water vapor maps) and geodesy (tropospheric delay maps).
